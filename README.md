# Chicago_weather_and_crime_2021
The project aims to analyze and understand the relationship between weather patterns and crime incidents in the city of Chicago throughout the year 2021. By leveraging SQL (Structured Query Language), the project will delve into a comprehensive dataset that combines weather data and crime records to uncover potential correlations and insights.

Data Sources:

Chicago Crime Dataset: The project utilizes a dataset containing detailed information about reported crime incidents in Chicago. It includes attributes such as the type of crime, location, date, and time of occurrence.
Chicago Weather Dataset: The project also incorporates a weather dataset specific to the city of Chicago, containing daily weather observations including temperature, humidity, precipitation, wind speed, and other relevant weather metrics.
Objectives:

Data Integration: The first step of the project involves merging the crime and weather datasets to create a unified database. This integration allows for meaningful analysis by associating specific crime incidents with the corresponding weather conditions on that day.

Exploratory Data Analysis: Using SQL queries, various exploratory analyses will be performed to gain insights into crime patterns and weather trends in Chicago. This analysis may involve aggregating crime incidents by different types of crimes, neighborhoods, and dates, as well as examining weather statistics such as average temperature, highest temperature, lowest temperature etc

Correlation Analysis: The project will investigate potential correlations between weather conditions and crime incidents. By leveraging SQL's analytical capabilities, statistical measures like correlation coefficients can be calculated to determine the strength and direction of relationships between weather variables and crime rates.

Temporal Analysis: The project will explore temporal aspects, including seasonal variations in crime rates and weather patterns. SQL queries can help in identifying patterns that may emerge during specific months, days of the week, or times of the day.

Case Studies: Selective case studies may be conducted to examine specific crime types or neighborhoods in detail, comparing their crime rates against weather conditions. These case studies will provide a more granular understanding of the relationship between weather and crime in different contexts.
